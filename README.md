Repository of components to add to Laragon

## About

This repository will contain an updated `packages.conf` file which will point to packaged applications that are installable using Laragon's *Quick Add* method.

It will also contain compress files of packaged applications that may be either installed using the *Quick Add* or by *download, uncompress and move* to the `laragon\bin\application_name` folders.
